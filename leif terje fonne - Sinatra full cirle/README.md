# Sinatra - Full circle

Today there is a lot of focus on big systems handling a zillion requests at the same time. But what about all the
small projects where ruby fits the bill perfectly. After years with ruby as development language I have found back
to fun in programming.  So this talk is about my experiences as a lone developer with total responsibilities
of the solution from idea to regularly( aka. weekly) deployment.  Briefly looking into the following factors
- idea (redmine)
- development environment (osx / windows) 
- testing (test unit)
- Host configuration ( chef & capistrano)
- deployment (capistrano)
- issue handling (redmine)
