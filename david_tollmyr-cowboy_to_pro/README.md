# From cowboy to pro - not having a clue shouldn't stop you

I used to have no idea what I was doing. I got a gig doing “web stuff” part time while studying to be an engineer in integrated systems.
After university i got asked to join a friends startup. There was one web server and we edited php scripts live.
Fast forward seven years and I'm on my sixth job since then, leading the development of a real time analytics engine in Ruby handling tens of thousands of request per second.
This is the story of three startups, boring enterprisey coding in .NET and some tough lessons.
Like the lesson of being picky and listen to my gut, learned the hard way by leaving a job after only one day. 
Or the passion gained by moving across the country and working all your waking hours on that fantastic idea you know is gonna change the world, and the disappointment of seeing it fail.

Schrödinger's cat walks into a bar, and doesn't...
I'm a geek first and a metal head second. I own two consoles, (only) 5 computers and two media players - and about the same value in musical gear.
My wardrobe is full of stuff from thinkgeek. My bar with single malts. My iphone with Devin Townsend, Dark Tranquillity and Dream Theater.
I currently work at Burt, aiming to revolutionize the ad industry by showing there are other metrics than clicks.
