# Convention over Configuration Design

## Abstract
How can we, as developers, build nice-looking, accessible, and usable web applications?
 
Why is it easier for a developer to build a nice looking Mac, iPhone or Android application over building a nice looking web application? The secret is in having predefined Human Interface Guidelines and UI components that are ready for developers to use on these platforms. What's equivalent to those guidelines and components in web development? What are the available solutions, and how can we make the most out of them? 
 
Rida Al Barazi will be talking about Design Patterns, Design Frameworks, available CSS frameworks and how to integrate them into our day to day Rails application development.

## Notes
When it comes to building web applications, developers tend to not be the best UI designers. It is not difficult to spot a “developer designed” application by its unaesthetic qualities and lack of design principles. 
 
This common problem is normally caused by developers mainly focusing on delivering the functionality of the application with very little attention to design principles, which are often undervalued by developers. 
 
Sometimes application wireframes and user-flows are provided but the final design is not; in this case, developers end up writing raw html and some basic CSS without thinking about details like paddings, margins, layouts and grids.
 
This problem is not normally seen in iOS, Mac or Android development because the platform itself has a strong UI library and a well defined Human Interface Guidelines. There are similar solutions in web development, such as Design Patterns and Design Frameworks, however they are not clearly specified and used.
 
Since Rails is a very powerful framework that advocates for convention over configuration in development, why not in design as well? Rails offers helpers and since Rails 3.1 CSS and JavaScript have been moved to be part of the application codebase in the “app” folder instead of being served as static files in the “public” folder. It is the perfect time to start implementing Design Patterns and Frameworks as a convention in the development process and start using CSS frameworks, like twitter bootstrap, to facilitate better looking Rails applications.
 
At this talk, Rida Al Barazi will present familiar Design Patterns and Frameworks and showcase useful techniques on how they can be implemented in Rails. These techniques are the new design conventions that will help the average Rails developer produce great looking web applications.
