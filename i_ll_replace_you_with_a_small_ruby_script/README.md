# I'll replace you with a small Ruby script

System administration can be automated completely. Day to day operations don't 
need the intervention of the guy that has root. 

Given some time and money, this goal can be reached today. We'll cover the
techniques used and the tools that are involved. A bit of consideration also
goes into what you build on when undertaking such a project. 

Far from being an exhaustive guide to the subject, we'll try to get an
overview and I'll share some war stories with you.
