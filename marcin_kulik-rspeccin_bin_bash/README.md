# RSpeccin' #!/bin/bash

In this talk I'm gonna present how you can spec your non-ruby programs. Showing real (r)specs for bitpocket, rsync based sync tool written as a bash script would be one part of the story, discussion of possible techniques to use when testing non-ruby scripts would be the other part of the story.

This topic wasn't covered by many speakers on Ruby conferences and I believe it would be interesting to listen about such a combo.
