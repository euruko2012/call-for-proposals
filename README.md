# EuRuKo 2012 Call For Proposals

So, you are interested in giving a talk at one of the coolest ruby
conferences in europe?
We couldn't think of any better way to do this than using github.

Here is what do to:

1. Fork this repository
2. Copy the sample folder `example/` to `your_name-talk_name/`
3. Edit the `README.md` file and type a good description about your talk
   and about yourself
4. Replace the `profile_picture.jpg` with a picture of yourself that we
   can use to list you on the speakers page when you are accepted.
5. Create a pull request of your fork

You can add any type of assets to support your proposal inside your
folder.
When a talk gets accepted we will press the lovely green merge button.
