So, you are interested in giving a talk at the most awesome Ruby
conference in Europe?
And what better way to submit a talk proposal than via GitHub!

## Here is what to do

1. Fork this repository
2. Copy the sample folder `example/` to `your_name-talk_name`
3. Edit the `README.md` file and type a good description about your talk
   and about yourself
4. Replace the `profile_picture.jpg` with a picture of yourself that we
   can use to list you on the speakers page when you are accepted.
5. Create a pull request of your fork

You can add any type of assets to support your proposal inside your
folder.
When a talk gets accepted we will press the lovely green merge button.
