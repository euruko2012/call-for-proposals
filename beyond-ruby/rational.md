# Why?

I think for every developer out there it is important to broaden the horizon,
learn about patterns and abstractions other developers came up with, no matter
if it was 40 years ago or just the other day. Ruby developers often assume
they reached the top of what is possible, and honestly, they aren't doing that
bad, but there is more out there, far more. Things Ruby as a language and we
as developers can learn from.
