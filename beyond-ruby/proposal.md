# Beyond Ruby

Ruby is the most flexible language out there, imposing no limitations on the
developers, giving all the expressiveness possible. Or so we think. But there
are languages pushing dynamic features and expressiveness far beyond what is
possible in Ruby. Some are old, like Lisp and Smalltalk, some are just
emerging, purely experimental languages, like Ioke or Newspeak. In this talk,
we will take a look at some of these languages and what they can do that Ruby
can't. What does it mean, to be homoiconic? How does a language without
keywords work? Can I dispatch in more than one direction? And what is partial
evaluation?
