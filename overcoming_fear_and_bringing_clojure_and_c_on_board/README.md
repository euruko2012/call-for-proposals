# Overcoming fear and bringing Clojure and C on board

There are many things that lay outside of your comfort zone. But solving problems in your knowledge domain will very soon lead to solutions that do not scale well, or would be not as good as ones that are already available in Java or C worlds.

Using Clojure for backend development opened up a world of Java libraries and allowed scaling that was not possible before.

AMQP allowed us to interconnect 3 languages (Ruby, C and Clojure) and turn our system into a scalable, extendable and modular one.

Once you start using these things, you can't imagine the world without them.

You'll hear an interesting story about how to:
 * build and open source 12 Clojure libraries (including, but not limited to "Langohr":(https://github.com/michaelklishin/langohr), "Monger":(https://github.com/michaelklishin/monger"), "Elastisch":(https://github.com/clojurewerkz/elastisch)
 * build your own Node.js on top of "libabbitmq-c":(http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-c/) and "libv8":(http://code.google.com/p/v8/), that would run on ARM-based devices with 200Mhz processor and 64Mb RAM
 * prototype in C, and iterate until it works in Ruby with FFI
 * build a distributed proxy
 * build systems, that interconnect Ruby and Clojure via AMQP

Alex works as a developer in a small, yet powerful team of 3, together with "Michael Klishin":(http://github.com/michaelklishin), and "Yaroslav Fedin":(http://github.com/lovelyscalabledrawings).
We develop security systems, payment solutions, crawlers, video distribution sytems for large German companies, bringing stable and secure solutions, based on Ruby, Clojure and C.
