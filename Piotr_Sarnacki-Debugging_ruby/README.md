# Debugging Ruby

I've noticed that not too many people in Ruby community use debugger. Some even say that it's a code smell. Why is that? Do you use debugger? And should you?

In this talk I would like to show how I use debugger in my daily job. I would also like to present a few use cases that are probably not so common when you think about debugger and show alternatives to the standard ruby-debug gem.
