# Lean DDD for hackers

What happens when Lean Startup meets Domain Driven Development? Do you 
think it may become a love story with a happy ending? Most of us hackers
know that while working for clients we have to get things done, but very
few of us know that we should also wisely choose what things to do. That 
we should eliminate waste from our design, architecture and code. This 
talk will attempt to present important business-related stuff and its 
influence on our code from the perspective of an uber geek and hacker.

## Notes

This talk will be a follow up to my recent blog post:

http://areyoufuckingcoding.me/2012/03/25/nothing-really-matters/

I want to present all my thoughts about Lean Startup, DDD and DCI and all
the things I learned while doing client's work this way. Very concrete, 
describing pros and cons of a few experiments of mine.

You can get entertaining, funny and very concrete presentation about 
the topic which hackers are afraid to talk about. Business is always important, 
we have to talk about it, talk about issues related with and looking for
the best technical solution of them. This is what people will get 
after my talk. Also they will all enjoy my fantastic Russian accent :).

## Krzysztof Kowalik

Chris is a 23 years old freak from Poland, easy to recognize by his strange
hairdos. He lives in Montevideo, in the far far away Uruguay, where people 
are boring and drink weird herbs from weirder vessels. Programming is his 
biggest passion what you can see through all his contributions to open source, 
blog posts and conference talks. On a daily basis he works at Cubox, crafting 
cool Go and Ruby stuff, plays with distributed systems, tweaks everything up 
and evangelizes people with The Unix Philosophy and Lean Domain Driven 
Development.

### Skills

Yet I'm very young I already have few talks behind me, from totally failed 
talk at Ruby Kaigi last year, through some talks at local user groups' meetups
or entertaining and beloved lighthing at RubyConf Uruguay up to stripping and 
dancing on the table at wroc_love.rb or trolling through HTTP at Evening with 
Go this year. I keep learning, keep experimenting and keep getting better so one 
day I can become as awesome as Fredie Mercury, so... Don't - stop - me - now!
(You sang that, didn't you?).

You can check all the talks I had until now marked green on my [changelog 
page](http://nu7hat.ch).

At the moment I have only video from my talk at StarTechConf last year available. 
I would love to have videos from wroc_love.rb or London's Evening with Go - these two
talks I gave last month would show my current presentation skills way better, I hope
you get to see them before you decide about my proposal :)
