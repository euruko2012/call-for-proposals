# With great power comes great responsibility

An open, free for all, language like ours gives great power.

The power to do it our way and to be monkey patching away is great. But it
is also dangerous.

The talk should be a lecture in favor of defensive, concise, clear minded
programming and not against monkey patching; Because monkeys can learn clear
mindedness 2 ;-)
