# Building Bulletproof Web APIs

Web APIs have become fantastically important in modern web development. More than just a way for third parties to interact with your data, most modern web applications can and should be architected as an API first and foremost.

In this talk you will learn concrete best practices related to API authentication, formatting, resource structuring, data structure separation, and more. You won't come out of this talk knowing everything you'll ever need to know about building APIs, but you'll know enough to ask every question you'll need to ask along the way.
