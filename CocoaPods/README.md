# CocoaPods - A tale of two star-cross’d communities

But with a happy ending! :sparkles:

This talk is about [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/), “The best way to manage library dependencies in Objective-C projects”. As the tag-line implies, this is a package-manager for Objective-C libraries, written in Ruby, promoting open-source libraries by providing a convenient way to work with them.

But besides a mere introduction to the project, and shameless plugs asking for more collaboration, this talk will also take a critical look at our usage of dependencies, when it has become so convenient as it has in our (Ruby) community.

This talk may, or may not, include ‘unicorns’, ‘rockstars’, ‘content’, and the likes.
