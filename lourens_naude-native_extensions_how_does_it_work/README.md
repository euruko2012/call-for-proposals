# Native extensions. How does it work ?

Ever seen those nasty configure / make backtraces on gem install or runtime segfaults ? Most of your critical product dependencies are native extensions, yet very few Rubyists understand how they work. With the Ruby VM ecosystem constantly growing, discrepancies between development and production environments and wrapped libraries not always evolving with stable interfaces, things can and will go wrong. I am the author of several bindings that run seamless on different Ruby implementations, cursed a lot to get there and in this talk I would like to touch on :

* The MRI C api VS foreign function interface (FFI)
* Basic structure and how extensions are loaded at runtime
* Plugging into the Ruby objects ecosystem and Garbage Collection
* Playing well with Threads
* When things go wrong
