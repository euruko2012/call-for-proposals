# Rebuilding government (with a little help from Ruby)

Starting in February 2010 a small group of developers, designers and product thinkers began work on [Alpha.gov.uk](http://www.alpha.gov.uk), demonstrating what a new, simplified and unified website for the UK government might look and feel like. Now with [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk) we're showing how it could operate, working with the intention that this will become the definitive government web presence. It's almost all ruby, largely open source and developed out in the open on github (where else?).

A key design principle has been "tools over content"; with an in-house team we can be a lot more creative than simply implementing a content management system. Instead we're focussed on providing citizens with clear, simple, appropriate guidance and utilities. That's had a huge impact on our architecture, sometimes good and sometimes less so. This talk will explore some of the trade-offs and what we're doing to simplify in the midst of growing attention, requirements and pace.

Along the way I'll also cover some of the lessons learned from scaling our team fast, baking in security practices, and practicing continuous delivery in a unique and especially risk-averse world.
