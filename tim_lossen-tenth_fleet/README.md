# The Tenth Fleet

It has become fashionable to bash "Large, Monolithic Rails Apps" as
evil and obsolete. So you run out and tear your lovely program up 
into pieces. Wait, now you have *five* problems!

In this talk, I am going to debunk the above myth, and argue that
monolithic apps work (and especially scale) extremely well -- you 
just have to be smart and get the overall architecture right. I will
present the "Fleet" pattern and explain how embracing (instead of 
trying to eliminate) single points of failure can paradoxically 
*improve* resilience and scalability.
