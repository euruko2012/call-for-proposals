# Enter the App Era with Ruby on Rails

Have you ever built a mobile app? Or a web app? 
Do you know how to build a single backend for supporting your web and mobile needs? 
In this speech we will discover how to build a simple application 
as a REST API in Ruby on Rails, and expose it as a web and a mobile app. 
We will see how to design and test REST APIs in a pure BDD style, using
Cucumber and RSpec.

I have given a similar talk at the Italian
[Codemotion](http://www.codemotion.it), you can get the slides here:
[Enter the App Era with Ruby on Rails](http://www.slideshare.net/matteocollina/enter-the-app-era-with-ruby-on-rails).

I’m a software engineer with a passion for coding, 
distributed architecture and agile methodologies. 
I’ve worked with a wide range of technologies 
(Java, Ruby, Javascript, Node.js) applying them to 
various fields (bank, turism, real estate). 
In 2011 I held a talk about mobile web development with Sencha Touch 
and Ruby at the [WhyMCA](http://www.whymca.org) and 
[RubyDay.it](http://rubyday.it) conferences. I'm also one of the
organizers of the [RubyDay.it](http://rubyday.it) conference.
