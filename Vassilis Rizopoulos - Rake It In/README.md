# Rake It In

Rake is the build tool of choice for Rubyists but how does it measure up outside the Ruby ecosystem?

Is the crazy idea of a programming language for your build scripts any good in the “real” world of curly braces?

Seriously though, isn’t Ruby slow for compiling stuff?

I have my IDE, what would I need rake for?

Programming is not gardening, get some serious tools!

Pfui! This talk will show you how to put rake to use in any environment and give you some tips on keeping even a big build system responsive and maintainable. Using Ruby as your glue rake will let you create one script to rule them all!

## Vassilis Rizopoulos

Been coding in Ruby for over 10 years and not once have I managed to create a Rails application.

In a world of curly bracers and JTAG debuggers I found shelter in the eloquence of Ruby and the role of team enabler.

Rake is my weapon of choice, automating stuff is my passion.
