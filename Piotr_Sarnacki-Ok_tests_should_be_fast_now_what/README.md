# Ok, my tests should be fast. Now what?

There is a huge movement in Ruby community going towards (or maybe getting back to) fast isolated unit tests. Using such approach may be a big success or a big fail for a project, depending on how well is it executed. Ok, so you decided that you want to try it and make your tests fast. What to do now?

In this talk I will try to show you how to write fast tests, do not create brittle test suite, don't write useless integration tests and basically stay sane in the process.
