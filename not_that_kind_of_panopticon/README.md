# Not that kind of Panopticon (or how we're publishing the government in Ruby)

In January 2012, a team of in-house Ruby developers at the Government Digital Service released the first iteration of the [GOV.UK beta](https://www.gov.uk/), showing how a single domain for the UK government could operate for citizens. This was soon followed by the [INSIDE GOVERNMENT beta](https://www.gov.uk/government/), showing how specialist departmental content could belong on GOV.UK, and later this year, content for business owners will also be available on GOV.UK.

To meet the needs of citizens, business users and those looking for specialist content, GOV.UK demands a solid publishing platform at its core. This talk will cover our approach to building and evolving a Rails publishing platform which can scale across propositions, provide a full editorial workflow process, and can make accountable each item of content to an user need we have identified. We'll also take a look at how we've iterated our data model to simplify our platform, and discuss a few of the 'growing pains' we've experienced in the process, and how we dealt with them.
