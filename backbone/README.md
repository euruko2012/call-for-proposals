# Backbone.js – Clientside MVC

We all want our applications to be faster and more responsive. We can do that with caching, faster database servers, etc… but we can also do that by writing more responsive front-end code.

Do we really need to go back to the server to re-render a page if someone adds a new comment? Or edits some text? Or uploads a new photo? Of course not. 

In the past writing these sorts of responsive front-ends would result in a mess of jQuery or MooTools code that was held together with chewing gum and luck. Now there's Backbone.js

Backbone.js is a powerful JavaScript model, view, and controller framework. 

In this talk we'll look at how to get Backbone.js up and running and we'll quickly build the canonical Todo application. We'll learn about Backbone models, views, and routers.

You'll be surprised at how quickly you can write the most responsive applications you've ever written, and how well organized and clean your code will be.
