# Drupal: what the Ruby community can learn from it

No matter how many rants about PHP there are: some of the software built with
it is the result of solid engineering. Drupal is one of _the_ killer
applications on the web. It features a broad ecosystem of components that can be
plugged together in order to compose diverse applications and websites. Here's
the point: you don't need to program.

And we can do that, too! Drupal's biggest drawback is PHP. As a programmer,
it often makes you compromise about code expressiveness and, in general, joy.
That's where we should prick our ears up. Let's succeed Drupal! Without
doubt we have all the tools we need. After all we're standing on the shoulders
of giants, right? So why not explore this new field, find out what Drupal is
doing right or wrong, and then surpass it? We'll need more than just a little
glue to accomplish this one, so I'm certain it will be exciting!
