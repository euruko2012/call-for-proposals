# Ruby & Erlang -- At Scale with Style

In the world of social gaming, the classic 2-tier of web application does not
cut it anymore. We need new and better solutions.

Follow along the evolution of game servers at Wooga and get an in-depth look
into the next-generation backend putting the combined forces of Erlang and Ruby
to work. Learn how scalability, reliability, concurrency control and beautiful
ode do not need to be mutually exclusive.

## Why?

Wooga is in the top three of the largest publishers of social games world-wide,
right behind Zynga and competing with Electronic Arts for 2nd place with almost
50 million active users every month on facebook. So we _really_ are talking
scalability here and some pretty unique insights are available for take-away.
