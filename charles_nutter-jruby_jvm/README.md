# JRuby and the JVM: What You're Missing

JRuby is Ruby for the JVM, right? But what does that really *mean*? What do
*you* get out of the deal?

We'll explore what makes JRuby unique among Ruby implementations, and why
the JVM is a Rubyist's dream come true. Using JRuby means you have the best
GC, real threads, easy and scalable deployment, high performance,
no-compile cross-platform libraries, and the best monitoring and profiling
tools of any VM. And you get it all without leaving Ruby behind. If you're
not using JRuby already, this talk will convince you to give it a try.

Charles has worked full-time on JRuby for six years, bringing Rubyists the
full power of the JVM.
