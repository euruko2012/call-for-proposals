# Using ruby for testing BASH - DTF / RVM

There is a lot of usage of ruby in any web frameworks,
but ruby is not only suitable to build way more than internet.

With Ruby we can do anything we imagine and I imagined the perfect testing framework (DTF).

Able to test anything you want:

- any language that can load interactive interpreter
- real scripts with tests in form of comments
- plugins for: interpreter, input, output, tests

Thanks to ruby it was possible to write plugable core in less than 200 lines,
a working framework including tests fitted in less then 1000 lines.

The talk will include talk on DTF code, the simple solutions that make it useful and good tool.
It will cover also uses for DTF, mostly on RVM examples.
DTF also gives support for testing shell projects using Travis which can be shortly described too.

And finally the talk will cover details of RVM usage, and everyone knows RVM,
but RVM has so many new and unused features, that can make life easier but are not properly advertised.
