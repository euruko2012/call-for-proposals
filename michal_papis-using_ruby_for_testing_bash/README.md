# Using Ruby for testing BASH - DTF / RVM

There is Ruby in a lot of web frameworks, but Ruby is suitable to build way more than web apps.

So I imagined the perfect testing framework (DTF) to test anything you want:

- any language that can load interactive interpreter
- real scripts with tests in form of comments
- plugins for interpreter, input, output and tests

Ruby made it possible to write a pluggable core in less than 200 lines
and a working framework, including tests, fitted in less then 1000 lines.

The talk will include specifics on DTF code and how it is a useful and good tool.
Examples will be provided but mostly with RVM examples.

If there is time I can go into details on using DTF for testing shell projects with Travis CI.

Finally I will talk about new and unused tricks for making life easier with RVM that are not properly advertised.
