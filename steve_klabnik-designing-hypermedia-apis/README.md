# Designing Hypermedia APIs

Rails did a lot to bring REST to developers, but its conception leaves the REST
devotee feeling a bit empty. "Where's the hypermedia?" she says. "REST isn't
RPC," he may cry. "WTF??!?!" you may think. "I have it right there! resources
:posts ! What more is there? RPC? Huh?" 

In this talk, Steve will explain how to design your APIs so that they truly
embrace the web and HTTP. Just as there's an impedance mismatch between our
databases, our ORMs, and our models, there's an equal mismatch between our
applications, our APIs, and our clients. Pros and cons of this approach will be
discussed, as well as why we aren't building things this way yet.
