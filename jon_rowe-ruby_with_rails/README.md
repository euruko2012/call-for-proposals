# Ruby With Rails

Rails is great, without it's principles and it's conventions over
configuration we wouldn't have the Ruby and Rails communities we have
today. In some quarters there is a Rails backlash going on; it's slow
they say; it get's in the way. The fact is that Rails allows us to build
app's fast; but it can make growing app's slow, testing becomes a pain
point. Taking our applications beyond the CRUD requires more effort,
more thought.

How do we grow beyond the conventions and create object orientated,
service focused applications in Ruby. Where do we divide the line
between speed and clean design. How much should we decouple from Rails?
Will we reach a point were Rails is surpassed?

The focus of this talk is based on my experience building decoupled
Rails applications, both as an employee and a freelancer; using
techniques from Object Oriented design, Dependency Injection and Data
Context Injection to produce cleaner, isolated Ruby code for faster
tests and reusable code.
