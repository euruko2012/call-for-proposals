The JVM is an awesome platform, and the ecosystem around it has many of the best frameworks and libraries that developer-kind have created.

How can you use Ruby when you work in a Java-only environment? I’ll show you some ways to sneak the goodness in from the side in the form of JRuby, and make you look twice as productive as your co-workers.
