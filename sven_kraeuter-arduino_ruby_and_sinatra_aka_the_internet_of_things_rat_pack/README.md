# Arduino, Ruby &amp; Sinatra - The Internet Of Things's Rat Pack

Frank, Sammy &amp Dean were a great team known as the "Rat Pack". What's true for these fellows is also true for Sinatra, Ruby and Arduino: put them together for instant awesomeness!

We all know and love Ruby, no Introduciotn necessary. Sinatra enables us to publish web services in the blink of an eye. Arduino is an Open Source (yeah!) Hardware (what?) Prototyping platform (huh?) that some of you may have heard of at last years Euruko's great introductory talk on the subject.

If you connect the strengths of these three mates, you're able to turn household objects into social objects. Examples range from the amazing talkative ping pong table a.k.a. [Occupy Ping Pong!](https://github.com/makersandco/Occupy-Ping-Pong) Makers & Co. did in cooperation with an Adverstising School, over the digital foosball table I prototyped for an agency last year to the [Empathic Servo](https://vimeo.com/27113323) which uses Ruby logic to translate between a face recognition software, the serial port and a servo motor.

To put it short: the Internet of Things is rising and although being a hardware centric concept it still needs some middleware <3 to nogotiate. That's where Arduino (Dean), Sinatra (Frank) and Ruby (Sammy) get together for rapid prototyping and instant aweseomeness!

## Sven Kräuter

Sven Kräuter is making things happen. Earning his living by bringing web apps to life in an agile manner he is also a strong advocate of the future things to come. He loves tinkering with hardware components and since he's too lazy to leave his tech stack, most of the time he lets hacked objects talk with each other with the language he loves the most: Ruby.

Besides developing online products with his customers, he is one quarter of [Makers &amp; Co.](http://makersand.co) where a bunch of _Internet Of Things_ aficionados are _Creating, Sharing & Connecting_ people via hardware hacks.
