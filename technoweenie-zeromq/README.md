# ZeroMQ: Supercharged Sockets

ZeroMQ is a community-driven high level socket API.  You can use it to build
strange chat services, or large distributed systems using it as a multi-core
concurrency framework.  I'll show you everything you need to start sending
thousands of messages at hundreds of sockets without breaking a sweat.

Note: Contains interactive demo that needs a functioning internal LAN.
