# Ruby on the Command-Line

Ruby, thanks to its various frameworks, is known to be *the* language
for web applications – and recent developments in graphic libraries
make it a worthy contestant in the world of GUI-driven desktop
programs. But Ruby is also great for writing command-line applications;
the ability to mix no-boilerplate toplevel functions with full-fledged
OOP means its usage can vary from one-off trivial scripts to
complicated, option-heavy commandline powerhouses.

This talk presetens the nits and bolts of writing a command-line
application with Ruby – from option parsing and accessing
standard input/output to playing nice with POSIX standards
like exit codes and signal/interrupt handling.
