# API: Assumptions Probably Incorrect

Interfaces are not created equal. Upon reaching the summit of a releasable product it is easy to lose site of where you started. The disconnect grows as you explore how to build a bridge from internals to end users. Developing interfaces for others is one of the hardest things we do, but thankfully you are not alone. I have spent a long time consuming APIs to cloud services with fog, and spend more and more time thinking about providing better API and CLI tooling for Heroku. By exploring examples we can see patterns and establish best practices for APIs, CLIs and even library code.
