# Of Remote Islands, Monsters, and Polyglot Knights

Dive deep into the mystical waters surrounding ye' olde mobile game development. Swim to this fantastical island ravaged by a foreboding and phoney creature protectively hovering over her shy, industrious cubs:  billy 'the choppy' bad con and jack 'the forgetful' sync. Scramble past forest and fawn to match riddles with the Polyglot Order of Artificial Intelligence, speaking their prescient lyrical language of Objective-C, Ruby, or Erlang. Come closer and listen to these stories of woe, of trials and tests in these dreadful lands.
