# Build A Non-Rails centric app

## The Elevator Pitch

Should Rails be the centre of your app? Do you spend more time worrying
about the framework than your business? if yes, then this is the talk
for you. If no, it'll be nice to know and interact with people on the
other side of the coin.


## Talk Description

I just want to clarify that I love rails and this is not a talk to
defame rails. 


I have been working on my start-up idea for about 8-10 months now,
mostly part-time. I wrote it with Rails at the centre and wasn't happy 
about the some of the code-base and the whole testing times. I wouldn't 
call myself a TDD fascist but I do like to approach a probelm from TDD 
perspective and it gets annoying if anything gets in the way. The use of 
Spork or Spin just for faster tests felt wrong.

I was eager to improve it and make it better and just didn't know how.
Then one then one fine morning, I decided to give it a major refactor, or like
some say rewrite. This talk will take you through my journey through
this unknown terrain. My intention is to share my thoughts before I
embarked on this project, what influenced and motivated me, my findings
and revelations and lastly, is this a viable thing to do?
