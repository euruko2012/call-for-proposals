# Ruby is unlike a banana

You cannot fall in love with a banana, and likewise, the VM which executes a banana doesn't have performance issues.

What goes behind the beautiful parts of the language that everyone takes for granted? What goes behind the ugly parts that everyone chooses to ignore? This is a talk about Ruby internals, and not-so-internals. A talk about the hundred pains that one encounters when building massive projects with Ruby, and about the hundred little pieces of joy that make you forget the pain. A love & hate story explained from the (hopefully) insightful point of view of a developer who works with Ruby, in one of the most successful Ruby-based companies in the world, even though he's not a Ruby programmer. And he wouldn't have it any other way.

## Vicent Martí

Vicent Martí has a name which is difficult to pronounce. Despite his main occupation as bananologist, he spends his spare time working full time at GitHub, where he builds tools for the people who build the Internet. His dreams invaded by shadowy figures: pink ponies and raw pointers, he loves sharing his love for what he believes is beautiful technology. An European citizen (Spain, according to his passport), Vicent enjoys drums and yellow things and the sweet sweet smell of civilization.

Enclosed is a picture of him, theorizing about a banana:
