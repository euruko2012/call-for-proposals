# How to slay a dragon - a developer's tale

Running a really big and complex application based on Ruby/Rails can seem like an impossible task. As a developer you need to stay informed about the latest trends and publications to be able to pick the right tools for the job at hand. But how to evolve as a developer when maintaining that huge code base of yours is eating up all of your time? The Ruby/Rails community is marching on at such a fast pace, that keeping up with it alone is a major task. Not to mention establishing a productive workflow or sharing knowledge throughout your team.

This talk tries to provide some ideas on how to solve this dilemma. It will also show how even bigger companies can benefit from an open minded approach towards agile development methods.

A lot of these experiences have been collected from the work on SUSE Studio, which allows the user to build custom software appliances, share them and even deploy them to the cloud. It's mostly written in Ruby and the web interface is running on Rails. Since its development already started in 2008, SUSE Studio has seen a couple of new major releases in both Ruby and Rails.


## Dominik Bamberger

I'm currently working for SUSE Linux as a Rails developer for SUSE Studio in Nuremberg, Germany. Riding the train since Rails 1 in 2005, I gathered some experience along the way.

Even though not all of my previous work has been open sourced, you can checkout my nifty little gem called [git-review](https://github.com/b4mboo/git-review). It let's you do code review for repositories hosted on GitHub from your command line interface.
