# Develop your consciousness

This talk is about you, as an individual and as a developer. This is a
talk about self discovery and awereness, about changing your
perspective on how you view life and how it can affect you as a
developer.

This is a series of reflections on what is being aware, about your
inner-self and about self-knowledge.  Some interactive elements during
this talk will be present to engage the audience on the topic.

The inspiration for this talk comes from several sources, yoga,
buddhism, etc.

After some basic introduction to the topic in general, their
principles will be applied to our day to day work and how they can
help us improve everyday.
