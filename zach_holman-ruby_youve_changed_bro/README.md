# Ruby: You've Changed, Bro
---
**Possible Alternative Title: How Mustaches Make for Better Ruby**

It's funny how things change. Smart ideas end up ruining everything. Quick hacks
end up becoming established practice. How we've written Ruby has changed over
the last fifteen years. We have this vague notion of "code quality", but what
does that actually *mean*? Let's grab a whole bunch of Ruby projects, pick them
all apart, and see what they say about making successful, lasting projects.

## Zach Holman

A Ruby developer with sound fundamentals, firm grasp on the industry, and
innovative development approaches are all phrases inapplicable to Zach Holman.
He works at GitHub, and hacks on sparkline generators, robot music DJs, and
ethically frightening FaceTime + Chatroulette mashups. He blogs, he tweets, he
evades his taxes.

## Holman Promiseâ„¢

I'm not going to lie; this talk is going to be great. I've already got zillions
of lines written of actual Ruby to support this talk. That's how you know I'm
serious. I'm using programming language.

Here, have a pug.
