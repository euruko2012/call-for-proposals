# Awesome Source: Lessons learned in open source

You've released your gem, it's wildly successful, now what?

[Powder](http://git.io/powder) shot to popularity along with the Rack server [Pow](http://pow.cx). From the start, we really encouraged contributions. A year later, Powder has GitHub stats of 504 watchers, 41 forks and 27 contributors - more than half the people that forked the project have contributed back.

This talk will relate some of the lessons learned managing Powder's development, including:

* how to handle situations when someone wants to take the project in a different direction to that which you intended,
* how to turn bug-reporters into pull-requesters,
* the _right_ way to merge in changes,
* pros and cons of the "no issues, just pull requests" policy,
* why you shouldn't change your name on GitHub (and other fun gotchas),
* documentation, front and center.
