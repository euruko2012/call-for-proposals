The Garbage Collector: how does it work?
What does it mean when people speak about stop-the-world, mark-and-sweep, generational garbage collectors?

What does it mean when they say 1.9.3's garbage collector has improved?
This talk will explain those concepts, what the impact of garbage collection is on our programs, and what future could be.
