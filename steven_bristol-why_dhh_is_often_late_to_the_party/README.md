This can be a talk or a panel that discusses issues revolving around things that are missing/lacking/wrong with rails. Solutions to these issues. 

* Rails is glue code not app code.
* If your business logic is mixed with your rails code (and your app is or ever will grow to any size) then you've made a mistake.
* Controllers/actions/routes are for the web not your app.
* Models are for your persistence layer not your app.
* Of course I have the answer for all of these problems.
* skinny controllers, skinny models, fat app.
