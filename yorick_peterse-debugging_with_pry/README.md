# Debugging With Pry

Pry is a powerful alternative to IRB that features syntax highlighting,
documentation browsing, breakpoint like behaviour and a wide range of plugins
that makes it possible to follow stack traces or even debug remote code.

This talk will show various features of Pry, how you can use it to debug your
code more easily, running multi user debugging sessions using pry-remote-em and
various other cool features.

## Yorick Peterse

I'm a developer working for small web development company in The Netherlands.
Most of the time I spend writing PHP and Javascript but I make up for that by
writing as much Ruby in my spare time as possible. I contribute to projects
such as Ramaze and Pry as well as working on some of my own projects.
