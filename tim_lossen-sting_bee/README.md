# Sting Like a Bee 
## Introducing the Swarm Architecture

It has become fashionable to bash "large, monolithic rails apps" as
evil and obsolete. So you run out and tear your lovely program up 
into pieces and make it all distributed .... wait, now you have *five* 
problems!

In this talk, I am going to debunk this myth, and argue that monolithic 
apps work and scale extremely well -- you just have to be smart and get 
the overall architecture right. I will present the "Swarm" pattern and 
explain how using unreliable protocols like UDP and *embracing* single 
points of failure (instead of trying to eliminate them) can paradoxically 
improve both resilience and scalability.

At Wooga, we have been searching for the "perfect" backend stack 
since three years. The swarm architecture, which will go into production
this autumn, is the latest evolutionary step on this journey.
