# Ruby NoSQL Patterns

How are people using NoSQL databases to leverage some of their biggest advantages. This talk will mostly cover using large scale NoSQL database deployments with a specific slant to using multiple databases per app. Featuring some of the things we learned in building applications this way and the tools we've come up with to solve some of the pain points.

Projects are frequently looking to NoSQL solutions in the hope they're a magical cure for all problems. We'll be looking at how NoSQL changes how you think about your data and how you really can model your application's data in a NoSQL solution. We've found in our experience in building NoSQL applications that how you imagine and handle your data can open up more possibilities than you had ever thought in your application.
