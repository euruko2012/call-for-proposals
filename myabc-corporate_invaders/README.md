# Corporate Invaders
## Building a “Corporate Operating System” with Ruby

_Joint talk by Pedro Visintin ([@pvisintin]) and Alex Coles ([@myabc])_


**No. Not Corporate Raiders. [Gordon Gekko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Gekko) stays at the door.**

Is this you?

- You want a system that lets you manage (and evolve) your business processes as easily as UNIX processes, but don't want to write a check to [Big Blue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Gekko).
- You hate the word Corporate, but love big, ambitious and technically demanding projects.
- You want to use Ruby.

Based on our personal experiences building a platform for Visa cards, we'll be taking a tour of the components you need to build the perfect “Corporate Operating System”.

### Ruote Workflow Engine

Ruote describes itself as an 'operating system for business processes'. We'll explain why you might want to look beyound state machines and start looking workflow engines.

### Messaging vs. REST APIs

We use REST and love it, but we'll discuss when you may be better off with messaging.
