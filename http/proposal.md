# We don't know HTTP

Everyone knows HTTP! Well, that's not entirely true. There are large parts unknown to most web developers, well, even browser vendors, as it seems, and the wheel is invented over and over again to fix issues we wouldn't even have, if people would make use of their toolbox. There are two options to fix this: You can reading RFC 2616 over and over again or you can listen to this highly opinionated talk exploring facets of HTTP that most developers are probably not too well aware of and how to make best use of it.
