# The Future is Dead: Long live the Past

We keep looking for good ideas to improve our code, to make our systems even more
powerful. But there are a lot of good ol' ideas that are resurfacing and most
of them were already thought about years ago.

I propose a journey through technology archeology to re-discover all that tools
that are buried deep into the internetz.

Remember the scriptures of ‘The unix way’, the HTTP reference engraved in stone
and learn from the elders about concurrency and single responsibility.

* Old new HTTP
* The Unix way in a modern world
* RDBs mystic powers
* ... more stuff for free

## Why should i care?

_We have a lot of COOL new technologies like a Nodejs Fibonacci server and stuff_

New technologies are great, but they are only a part of all the old ones that
are buried in people's mind. I want to show the amazing ideas that were crafted
years ago and are waiting to return.

_Old things are old and … like… old stuff sucks_

A lot of old stuff sucks but a lot of it can teach us the way of crafting
optimized code and solid solutions without being monolithic. And remember
satellites and spaceships code were made without EC2.
