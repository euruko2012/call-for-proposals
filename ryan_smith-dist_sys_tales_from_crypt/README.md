# Distributed Systems: Tales From the Crypt.

A year ago we thought it would be a good idea to start pulling apart services from our core application. Today we have a network of services with clear boundaries, well defined semantics, and concise APIs. The last year was one of the toughest and most enlightening years of my programming life. In this talk I will share the tragedies, heartaches, and victories that we experienced in our migration towards distributed systems. We will look at some patterns and anti-patterns that were discovered along the way. Of course we will be talking about Ruby, PostgreSQL, and their roles in our distributed system.
