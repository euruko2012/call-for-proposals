# It's All Ruby. Chef for Rubyists

Practically all Ruby developers use automated tools to deploy their code today, be it good old _Capistrano_
or elaborate post-receive hooks in _Git_. It's just a small step to approaching the whole infrastructure
in a similar way.

Everybody knows that [_Chef_](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home), one of the major players in the
“provisioning automation” field, is written in Ruby.
Not everybody who knows Ruby, though, knows how to put their knowledge to great use with _Chef_.

In my talk, I would like to guide the audience through realworld examples of how to use their Ruby skills
to write elegant and powerful _Chef_ cookbooks, recipes and wrappers, and, ultimately, how to become masters
of their infrastructure.

Among the topics presented would be:

* Basic introduction to the concept of _Chef_
* The great dev/ops divide
* Built-in ways of extending _Chef_ tool
* Loading data bags and using full text searches
* Using Ruby code in _Chef_ cookbooks
* Writing custom extensions to the _Chef_ DSL
* Using _Chef_ API from custom Ruby code
* Writing wrappers for full stack automation in the cloud
