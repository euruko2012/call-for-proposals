# Therapeutic Refactoring

Enter deadline center stage, exit best practices, _quietly_, rear stage left.

The results are rarely pretty.

Refactoring can pry panic's fingers away from your poor, overburdened adrenal glands and restore your sanity. Not that it went missing, of course. Never that!

This talk will cover the two reasons why refactoring works as well as (or better than) whiskey, sky diving, and massages as therapy, explore a handful of effective strategies to ensure that the rubber meets the road, and contains gory before shots and slick after shots of ruby code that has served therapeutic purpose.

## Notes to the reviewers

This is an in-the-trenches style talk that looks at a less commonly talked about set of benefits of refactoring and TDD.

I have a lot of code examples that provide talking points for the main points in the talk. These are

* you can concentrate on results or you can pay attention to what you're doing. One of these works better than the other.
* choosing to do something right just for the sake of doing it right can put you smack dab in the middle of flow. Flow is nice.
* when refactoring for sanity rather than to achieve some benefit in the code, you can work in such pure isolation that you can get your feedback/TDD cycle down to less than a second. This is one one hell of a zen experience, and can change the way you work the rest of the time.
* pure isolation has another benefit: it forces you to work on boundaries in your code, and you accidentally become a better programmer.
