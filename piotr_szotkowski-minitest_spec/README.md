# Going Clean and Simple with minitest/spec

The Ruby community is known for praising well-tested code, with
a lot of projects being developed in a test- (or spec-) driven
fashion. minitest/spec is a simple and minimalistic DSL for
behaviour specification and behaviour-driven development, gaining
popularity ever since being a part of Ruby 1.9 standard library.

This talk presents minitest/spec’s virtues and vices, the benefits
and drawbacks of mocking with minitest/mock, as well as the interesting
world of asserting algorithmic performance with minitest/benchmark.

_Note: I also have [some other talks I would love
to give](https://github.com/chastell/talk-proposals),
so if you prefer any of the other topics just let me
know and I’ll happily switch._
