# krypt - the next level of Ruby cryptography

krypt - What is it?
  Why do we need this? What's so bad about OpenSSL?

The headaches of being bound to OpenSSL
  OS X Lion deprecates it, Fedora moves away from it, Windows never had it
  JRuby devs have to bend their knees in order to emulate it
  Second-class crypto citizens everywhere

The dark corners of OpenSSL
  Certificate validation
  Validation of certificates
  Checking whether a certificate is valid
  Others

Enter krypt
  Runs on all Rubies
  Equally fast 
  Sometimes faster than native code
  Create custom ASN.1 data types on the fly
  May be powered by arbitrary native crypto libraries
  Fully documented
  Exhaustive specs & test vectors 
  Idiomatic Ruby API
  

## Martin Bo√ület

Martin is a crypto nerd, performance junkie and a language geek. One thing lead to another
and he became a Ruby core committer in 2011 and soon after, one of the maintainers of the OpenSSL 
extension. He recently received a Ruby Association grant to kickstart his work on krypt, and
he would like to share the experience with you in this talk.
