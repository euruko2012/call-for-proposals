# My talk title

Ruby on Rails - Automated Project Setup Best Practices

# Abstract


As Ruby on Rails projects become larger and more complex, more local and remote services are needed by the applications. New teammates, unequal distribution of knowledge, keeping the setup documentation up-to-date, running the test infrastructure and many more problems can easily get out of control.

Find out, how to successfully manage the chaos using real world solutions. We want to share our project experiences using an automated setup, heaps of Ruby tools, complex deployment scripts and the use of cloud services to save time, money and lots of headache

# Content

* Best practices for large projects
* Using different tools and services to automate the project setup
* Describing current problems:
  - Integrating different products and services into one application
  - Setting up local services like mysql, Resque, search server, monitoring, version control,
  webserver, any products
  - Maintaining project setup documentation
  - Different ruby versions
  - Limited disk space
  - Long running integration tests
  - Not equally distributed knowledge, not everyone knows everything in complex projects
* Proposing real world solutions
  - Bundler, rbenv, rake, chef
  - Cloud services (airbrake, github, scalarium, ...)
  - Vagrant/vm/amazon
  - "doing it once" (scripted)
  - Rails generators
  - Private gemfury
  - Capistrano deployment
* Explaining the beneﬁts and time savings
  - How much time saved
  - Might take time in the beginning, but saves time for each teammate
  - Possibility for a quick prototype or even demo application
  - Developer, designer, student doesn't need to know every single detail or entire history
  - Code is the setup documentation and single responsibility and DRY
  - Simpler conﬁguration using cloud services
  - Easier to understand the application infrastructure
