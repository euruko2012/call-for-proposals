# Performance Strategies For Ruby and the Web

Rails apps today suffer from the same performance stigma that Java did in the
90s. Luckily, Ruby has been catching up to the competition in performance. In
this talk, you will receive a walkthrough of how to identify, improve, and
maintain site speed while minimizing extra complexity. You will learn about
topics including code profiling, HTTP/reverse proxy caching, fibers and
threads, and stress testing.

**Notes:**

For the talk, a big part of the focus is to help developers find a balance
between optimizations and complexity. Optimizing performance generally leads
to more complex code, but I want to show that there are existing concepts and
tools that can help developers build blazing fast sites without running into a
bunch of caching headaches.
