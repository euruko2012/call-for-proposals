# Modular & reusable front-end code with HTML5, Sass and CoffeeScript

A lot of Ruby developers use Rails for their everyday projects. Often they toy around with front-end themselves or outsource it, ending up tangled in a web of css-all-over-the-place.

Keeping your front-end code clean is hard. Before you know it you're suffering from CSS specificity issues and not-really-generic partials. Find out how to keep things tidy using the HTML5 document outline and modular Sass & CoffeeScript, for truly reusable code.


## Notes for reviewer

Based on my experience in front-end in general and Haml, Sass/Compass and CoffeeScript in specific I'd like to share how to create truly modular and reusable front-end code for projects of any size.

Things to cover: how does the HTML5 document outline help with creating reusable chunks of code, how to structure your HTML and Sass in a way that enables reusing "modules" and how to bind JavaScript events without tying your JS too closely to your HTML and CSS. I'll touch on the asset pipeline too.

I have given this talk at [wroc_love.rb](http://wrocloverb.com/) in Wroclaw, Poland and [RubyNation](http://www.rubynation.org/) in Reston, VA (USA) in March (other conferences pending, none in The Netherlands).

I'm co-founder of Ruby consultancy [80beans](http://www.80beans.com/), where we build awesome products for our international clients. We also founded [SliceCraft](http://slicecraft.nl/), the only company globally that offers PSD-to-Haml/Sass services. In addition I try to [blog](http://roytomeij.com/) and am an contributing author for [TheSassWay.com](http://thesassway.com/). You can [find me on Twitter (@roy)](http://twitter.com/roy).

I have presented on the basics of Haml/Sass/Compass/CoffeeScript at various local user groups and at [ArrrrCamp](http://arrrrcamp.be/) in Belgium ([video](http://arrrrcamp.be/videos/2011/roy-tomeij---stop-swashbucklin-and-shipshape-yer-front-end/)). In September I'll be giving a full-day workshop on CSS pre-compilers for Fronteers, the Dutch association of professional front-end developers.

My English is close to fluent, I was trained to be a teacher and I have experience in improv theater. I try to combine all of this into an informative, yet fun to attend presentation. Be advised: my slides may contain funny animals or pictures of Bob Ross.
