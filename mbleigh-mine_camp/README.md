# Mine Camp: Build a RubyGem from Scratch

One of the best things about the Ruby language is how easy it is to become involved in the open source community. While it may seem daunting to newcomers, building RubyGems is actually very simple and straightforward.

At Mine Camp you will learn how to build a RubyGem from scratch while also learning the community best practices and tools to help you along the way. Topics will include:

* Creating Your First Gem
* Gem Testing
* How to Release a Gem
* Project Maintenance
* Open Source Community Management

**Note:** This is more of a beginner talk, so please ignore if the audience won't match.
