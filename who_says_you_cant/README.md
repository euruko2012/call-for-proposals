# Who says you can't have a successful large Ruby team!

I will talk about my experiences working with a Ruby team at one of India's most exciting startups, Flipkart.com. We have been building a large project with RESTful Padrino services running on JRuby and Rails frontend applications running on MRI that talk to these services.

I will talk about challenges arising from coordinating a team of 40 Ruby developers working on 15 different services. We had to be able to share code across all the different projects. We also had to deal with distributed transactions. The project had automated continuous deployment to testing servers to gather feedback on the viability of each successful build of the codebase.
