# Everything needs an API.

Building an API can be hard, but thanks to my mistakes: YOU TOO can write a sensible easy to maintain HTTP/JSON API for your product.

I don't have all the answers, but I've spent the last 9 months writing 2 interconnected APIs. We've re-written some parts, thrown some away, and turned others into open source libraries. I've been thankful for some decisions, and cursed for others.

Altogether we've learned a lot.

Let's review the process we took, and how I would do it differently next time.
