# Deploy an End to Homelessness: Hourschool & The 12 Factor App

Hourschool has a website, but they're not in the web business. They're in the people business. Hourschool builds communities that empower individuals using peer lead classes. The less time they spend worrying about their servers, the more time they have to talk to their customers. That's why Hourschool chooses to build their service using the 12 factor app.

The 12 Factor App is a set of development methods, synthesized from observing hundreds of thousands of apps, that gives you the tools to build out your service, focus on what matters, and to quit worrying about how to stay stable. Using the 12 factor app you can minimize software erosion, and keep the contracts between your code and your systems clean.

In this presentation we'll take a look at how Hourschool uses the 12 Factor App to eliminate downtime and scale their service on demand. You'll walk away with practical examples of how to improve your application code, and the way your team works on it.
