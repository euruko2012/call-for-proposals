# Your infrastructure is obsolete, deprecate it!

At Engine Yard, we run thousands of virtual machines for our clients,
but the services that we designed years ago to provision those 
VMs and give service to our customers has become obsolete.

This talk is about how we're deprecating these services without 
forcing our customers to move forward neither abandon us. 
We'll talk about software as a service to provision big cloud infrastructures, 
and how our underlying services configure instances 
for users running bleeding edge Ruby technologies, 
without abandoning customers that still use Ruby1.8.6+mongrel. 
We'll talk about Chef, how to use it efficiently and also 
how to get that nobody in your team want to use it anymore. 
But most important, we'll talk about customers' happiness and how it's hidden behind a simple mouse click.
