# Linked Data and Hypermedia APIs: a match made in heaven

So you're excited about ~~REST~~ Hypermedia APIs. But you wonder: what are these
media-types Steve constantly talks about? Right, they define how state and state
transitions are represented. So they add semantic meaning to your API. And then
you wonder again: can't we just use all those formats that were invented for
exactly that cause? You're right, that's what we should do. In fact, formats
of the Semantic Web/Linked Data family are the perfect match for Hypermedia
APIs.

In this talk I'll give a brief overview of some of the existing Linked Data
formats (RDF, n-Triples, Microdata), vocabularies (Dublin Core, Friend of a
friend, Music Ontology) and Ruby libraries. I'll then show how we can use
JSON-LD as the foundation for a real-world API's media-type.
