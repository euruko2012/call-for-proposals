# Your Application, Your Business

Frameworks and libraries are meant to save one some precious time when
bootstrapping a new killer app. It's what they're meant for.

Most projects will be small and simple enough that no real problem emerge, but
when your application becomes bigger, and older, even the best language and the
best libraries won't reduce the cost of change, and improve the
maintainability.

If you ever tried to upgrade your dependencies and failed at it, this
presentation is probably for you.
