# Persist, Little Objects!

Object persistence in Ruby is a tricky subject – everyone knows how
to do it (‘simply use an ORM, plug it into a relational database and
you’re done!’), most know the drawbacks (‘well, sure, you need to use
a document database for the more schema-less cases… or serialise the
variable parts… and, of course, object references need to be handled
separately…’), but few experiment with alternatives.

This talk, after recalling the popular database-driven persistence
solutions, concentrates on the less known, but more interesting
and often quite useful approaches – from file-based PStore (ideal
for small apps), through Candy’s out-of-the-way magic, to MagLev’s
true cross-process transparent object persistence.

_Note: I also have [some other talks I would love
to give](https://github.com/chastell/talk-proposals),
so if you prefer any of the other topics just let me
know and I’ll happily switch._
