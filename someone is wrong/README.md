# Someone is Wrong

Inspiration strikes you, you've done it. You have found the missing 7 letters from the MVC model. This changes everything. You start discussing it with your pair. 10 minutes later you somehow find yourself arguing if mocks are good or bad. Jettisoning your pair you gather all you're fellow colleagues for a quick discussion. Bracing yourself you unleash the full power of your words. 10 minutes later and somehow your idea has been lost and the discussion has devolved into discussing if mocks are good or bad. You're not quite sure what happend but you walk away realising you failed to convince your team or pair of this amazing concept. Maybe it was a bad idea, maybe it was the idea that would make everyones life better. Being able to convince and discuss your idea is the skill of Rhetoric. A tool no developer can live without.
