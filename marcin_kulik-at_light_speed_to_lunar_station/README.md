# At light speed to lunar station

This talk covers the topic of using infrastructure automation tool, specifically Chef, for non-admin-non-cloud-non-devops task: setting up developer's workstation at Ruby shop.

Why? Because machines can (and should!) do this work for us. Why Chef and not simple bash script? Because Chef abstracts platform specifics which is perfect when you target multiple developers with diverged OS preferences (OSX, Ubuntu, Fedora, ArchLinux and whatnot).

I'll present how you can use [Lunar
Station](https://github.com/LunarLogicPolska/lunar-station) or how you can prepare such a tool by yourself for your organization. This talk shows a different point of view on using a tool that is always associated with "Cloud" and thus I believe it would be entertaining for Ruby devs bored with "usual" Chef talks.
