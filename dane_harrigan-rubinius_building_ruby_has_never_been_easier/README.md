# Rubinius: Building Ruby Has Never Been Easier

> I'd like to help Rubinius, but I don't know how. What is RubySpec?
> How do I actually build Ruby in Ruby?

I'll walk through the entire process of contributing working code to
Rubinius. From finding a failing spec to receiving commit bit, we'll
cover the details and contribute to Rubinius in the process.

Below is a list of the areas I'll cover:

  * Find a problem
  * Unsure? Confirm the spec passes in MRI
  * See what MRI is doing
  * Use the MSpec debugger
  * Solve the problem
  * Profit
