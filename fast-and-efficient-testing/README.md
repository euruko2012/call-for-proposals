# Fast and Efficient Testing

We are really passionate about testing at Hashrocket. We test drive all our
development and although that produces fantastic results, running and
interacting with the test suite can sometimes really slow you down. As the
suite gets larger, it inevitably becomes considerably slower and sometimes to
the point that you just don't want to execute it anymore. Between slow boot
times, context switching between your editor and terminal, and just a large
number of scenarios, it can be very frustrating!

It is a blessing and a curse that large and complex test suites are a way of
life for many of us as our community and projects mature. To mitigate these
problems, we leverage some tools and procedures to keep the interruption of the
test suite to a minimum. I want to share with you what we've done to keep our
test suites running fast and what you can do to start taking back control of
yours. Everyone on the team should be able to run the suite at any time and it
shouldn't consume their whole day!

In this talk, we'll discuss the different aspects of test suites that are
most problematic. I'll show you what tools we leverage to make things as fast
as possible without compromising the thoroughness of the testing. You'll be
able to take the lessons learned here back to your project and spend less
time running your tests today!
